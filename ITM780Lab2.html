<!-- This is a comment. Comments are for developers only and aren't visible on the webpage. -->
<!-- DOCTYPE tag signifies an HTML document -->
<!-- Actual HTML document begins with the html tag -->
<head> 
<!-- Website metadata. This is also where CSS (website styling) and JavaScript (functionality) are linked. 
Everything in the head is not visible to the user (except the title, which is dislplayed on the browser tab)-->
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>Hemanshu Bhargav</title>
</head>
	
<body> <!-- Website body. Everything visible on the website is here. Anything outside the body tags is not visible. -->
	
	<!-- Step B. Heading Tags. There are 6 sizes on a scale from 1-6, with 1 being the largest. -->
	<h1>This is my first webpage</h1> 
	<h2>This is a smaller heading</h2>
	<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
	<h4>Heading level 4</h4>
	<h5>Heading level 5</h5>
	<h6>This is the smallest heading</h6>
	
	<!-- Step C. Paragraph Tag -->
	<p>This is a paragraph. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Rem, nihil dolor atque alias quaerat consectetur ratione natus laborum esse? Reprehenderit in, laboriosam. Quos hic, eligendi ea obcaecati voluptatibus libero provident.</p>
	
	<!-- Step D -->
    <!-- Line break tag -->
	<br>
	<!-- Horizontal rule tag. Not as common in modern website design, but you can use these until we learn CSS next lab. -->

	<!-- Step E -->
	<h1>The Power of the Web</h1>
	<p>According to Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, at https://www.w3.org/Press/IPO-announce:</p>
	
	<!-- Creates an indented quote in your page -->	
	<blockquote>
	The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.
	</blockquote>

	<hr>
	
	<!-- Step F -->
	<h1>My Favourite Courses</h1>
	<!-- Ordered List. Each list item in an ordered list is denoted using the li tag -->
	<ol>
	<li>ITM780</li>
	<li>ITM445</li>
	<li>ITM100</li> <!-- Notice the list item tag appears before the ordered list closing tag -->
	</ol>
	
	<hr>
	<!-- Step G. Unordered List -->
	<h1>My Favourite Fruits</h1>

	<!-- Step H. Description list -->
	<h2>Descriptive Lists</h2>
	<dl> <!-- dl = description list. dt = description term. dd = description of term -->
	<dt>HTML</dt>
	<dd>The hypertext markup language of the web.</dd>
	<dt>CSS</dt>
	<dd>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), as the name suggests adds style to our barebones HTML.</dd>
	</dl> <!-- Note closing tag of list is after all terms and corresponding descriptions -->
	
	<hr>
	
	
	<!-- Step I. Special Characters and Formatting -->
	
	<!-- Copyright special character -->
	<!-- Ordinarily, a copyright statement is placed in the footer, after all content, but for the sake of 
         example we'll use it to illustrate the concept. -->
	<p>Copyright &copy; 2021 Hemanshu Bhargav. All Rights Reserved.</p>
	
	<!-- Copyright special character with bold text -->
	<p><strong>Copyright &copy; 2021 Hemanshu Bhargav. All Rights Reserved.</strong></p>
	
	<!-- Non-breaker space special character (adds additional spacing) -->
	<p><small>Copyright &copy; &nbsp; 2021 Hemanshu Bhargav. All Rights Reserved.</small></p>
	
	<!-- Step J. Validate your HTML by inputting it here https://validator.w3.org/ -->
	
	<!-- Step K. Create a new HTML file and try structuring this page or another page using the following -->
	<nav></nav> <!-- See https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_nav.asp for details -->
	<header></header> <!-- See https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_header.asp for details -->
	<div></div> <!-- See https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp for details -->
	<footer></footer> <!-- See https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_footer.asp for details -->
	
	<div> <!-- Divides up your content --> 
	<!-- Note the dotted lines in the preview pane only show up on Dreamweaver -->
			
	<!-- 
	Step L	 
	Used to link external websites or files in your folder. 
    Put your URL in href and the text to display in between the tags 
     -->
	
	<!-- Header tag. Used to introduce a new section. Pairs well with <article> but not necessary -->
	<header><h1>My University</h1></header><br>
	<a href="https://www.ryerson.ca/">Click here to visit the university homepage!</a>
	
	</div>
	
	<!-- 
	Like div, section divides up your content, but has attributes which make it more accessible
    for screen readers used by users who are blind or low-vision. Attributes will be discussed next week
    -->
	
	<section>
	
	<!-- End your page with a footer -->
	<footer><p><small>Copyright &copy; 2021 Hemanshu Bhargav. All Rights Reserved.</small></p></footer>
		
	</section>
	
</body>
